# Riffle Roadmap

- **Current Build:** `v0.5.0-alpha`
- **Current Stage:** `Stage 4: Infrastructure Foundation`

This roadmap is organized by **capability maturity**, not linear feature completion.
Stages may overlap intentionally as the platform evolves.

> *Validating the core idea with minimal viable gameplay.*

- [x] **Phase 1: Core Gameplay Loop**
  - [x] Music playback during active sessions.
  - [x] Timed question answering.
  - [x] Basic score calculation.

- [x] **Phase 2: Initial UI**
  - [x] Question view & answer selection.
  - [x] Timer bar & basic audio visualizer.

## Stage 3: Platform Architecture & Tooling
> *Refactoring into a scalable, maintainable platform.*

- [x] **Phase 1: Structural Overhaul**
  - [x] Monorepo setup (TurboRepo, Apps/Ops split).
  - [x] Service separation (Core API, Worker, Engine).
  - [x] Multi-environment strategy (Dev/Test/Stage/Prod).

- [x] **Phase 2: Developer Tooling**
  - [x] Biome (linting & formatting).
  - [x] Commitlint & Husky.
  - [x] Release-it.
  - [x] Trapeze (mobile config).

- [ ] **Phase 3: Runtime Communication**
  - [ ] Typed WebSocket layer (Socket.io + Zod).
  - [ ] Inter-service HTTP communication (Node ↔ Go).

## Stage 4: Infrastructure Foundation
> *Establishing a cloud-native, zero-trust baseline.*

- [ ] **Phase 1: Local Orchestration**
  - [x] Docker Compose modularization (Dev/Test).
  - [ ] Kubernetes local lab (Kind, multi-node).

- [ ] **Phase 2: Networking**
  - [ ] Cilium CNI integration (eBPF).
  - [ ] Baseline NetworkPolicies.

- [ ] **Phase 3: Ingress & Edge**
  - [ ] Kong Ingress Controller.
